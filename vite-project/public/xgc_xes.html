        The Eratosthenes Sieve
        <hr />
      </h3>

      <p>
        We know the Eratosthenes Sieve as a method for selecting primes from the
        sequence of natural numbers. The algorithm of the sieve is very simple:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><b> ES (for prime numbers) </b></dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Initialize: you write down the natural sequence starting from 2
            </li>
            <li>
              Sieve: you repeatedly scan the base sequence proceeding from less
              to greater indexes, select the first number p you find unmarked
              and mark a number each p
            </li>
            <li>
              Terminate: at any moment you interrupt the scan, you can select
              all the unmarked numbers less than the square t of the least of
              them. All the selected numbers are all the prime numbers up to t
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        As all the primes except 2 are odd, we would like to find an
        Eratosthenes-like Sieve for applying only to odd numbers. Such a sieve
        not only exists, but it is still the Eratosthenes Sieve, provided that
        we change the "Initialize" step in this way:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><b> ES for odd prime numbers </b></dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Initialize: you write down the <nobr>1 + 2 k</nobr> sequence
              starting from 3
            </li>
            <li>
              Sieve: you repeatedly scan the base sequence proceeding from less
              to greater indexes, select the first number p you find unmarked
              and mark a number each p
            </li>
            <li>
              Terminate: at any moment you interrupt the scan, you can select
              all the unmarked numbers less than the square t of the least of
              them. All the selected numbers are all the prime numbers up to t
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        The ES practically didn't change because of the fact that each odd
        natural, that happens to be a multiple of a given odd prime p, is
        located (off from the previous multiple of p) at
        <nobr>2 p</nobr> positions counting in the natural sequence, but only at
        p positions counting in the odd sub-sequence.<br />
        So, marking in the natural sequence a number each p corresponds to
        pre-marking all the numbers of the <nobr>2 k</nobr> sub-sequence and
        marking in the <nobr>1 + 2 k</nobr> sub-sequence a number each p.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <p><u>Example</u></p>
        <p>
          <nobr>
            0: <b>2</b>, <u>4</u>, <u>6</u>, <u>8</u>, <u>10</u>, <u>12</u>,
            <u>14</u>, <u>16</u>, <u>18</u>, <u>20</u>, ...<br />
            1: <b>3</b>, 5, 7, <u>9</u>, 11, 13, <u>15</u>, 17, 19, <u>21</u>,
            ...
          </nobr>
        </p>
        <p>
          The line 0 lists all the even numbers and the line 1 all the odd ones.
          Selected primes are bold and marked multiples are underlined. The
          number 3 is the given odd prime, and the numbers 9, 15, 21, ... are
          the multiples of 3. As you can see,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            9 is at <nobr>2 3 = 6</nobr> positions off from 3 if you count both
            lines<br />
            but it is at only 3 positions off if you count the line 1 only
          </li>
          <li>
            15 too is at 6 positions off from 9 if you count both lines<br />
            but it is at only 3 positions off if you count the line 1 only
          </li>
          <li>
            21 too is at 6 positions off from 15 if you count both lines<br />
            but it is at only 3 positions off if you count the line 1 only
          </li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        We have to note that the "Sieve" step is highly optimized for the
        structure of the sequence given in the "Initialize" step, ie it is
        strictly bound to the concept of equally spaced terms in the base
        sequence.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a method for selecting exactly the same odd primes that doesn't
        use that feature. Instead, the alternate method use the concept of
        coprimality, ie the fact that two numbers have no common factors except
        1. Of course, this concept is closely related to the definition of a
        prime number.<br />
        Testing two numbers for coprimality is not a difficult task and is far
        cheaper (in terms of computing resources) than testing a number for
        "simple" primality. In fact, testing for coprimality is as simple as
        calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and, thanks to the
        <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm"
          target="wikipedia"
          >Euclidean algorithm</a
        >, the GCD is a simple task.<br />
        If the two numbers are a and b, then a and b are coprimes iif
        <nobr>GCD[ a, b ] == 1</nobr>
      </p>

        or without a rule for determining any number of the set. By definition:

        If we know that the set is ordered and equally spaced then it is
        possible to optimize XES, just like ES, because of a nice property of
        that kind of sets.<br />
        Let's name m the space between adjacent terms. If the n-th term of the
        set is equal to <nobr>f g</nobr>, then each
        <nobr>(n + f k)-th</nobr> term is equal to
        <nobr>f g + f k m = f (g + k m)</nobr>, ie the "Sieve" step has to mark
        each <nobr>(n + f k)-th</nobr> term of the set, as well as each
        <nobr>(n + g k)-th</nobr> one.
