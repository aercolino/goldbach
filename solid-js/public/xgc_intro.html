      <p>
        XGC(c,m) is a generalization of GC by means of two parameters: c and
        m.<br />
        This way GC becomes the instance of XGC(c,m) for c=1 and m=2, or
        <nobr style="color: red">GC&nbsp;=&nbsp;XGC(1,2)</nobr>
      </p>

      <p>
        As well as GC is about numbers of the Primes set, so XGC(c,m) is about
        numbers of the Euclid(c,m) set.<br />
        Note that the Odd Primes set is the instance of the Euclid(c,m) set for
        c=1 and m=2, or
        <nobr style="color: red">OddPrimes = Euclid(1,2)</nobr> and it's so by
        construction, not by definition. In fact, as well as prime numbers are
        found by ES applied to natural numbers, so Euclid(c,m) numbers are found
        by XES applied to the numbers congruent to the residue c of the modulus
        m.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following table shows GC and XGC side by side, so that you can
        easily compare them. As you see, XGC is a simple generalization of GC.

      <h3>
        History of XGC
        <hr />
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1993-Mar:</b> I was made aware of the Goldbach's Conjecture for the
          very first time. At the time I was 25 years old and was studying at
          the Universit&agrave; di Roma "La Sapienza", Facolt&agrave; di
          Ingegneria, Diploma di Informatica e Automatica. My Algebra teacher,
          Prof. Paolo Maroscia, told us about that conjecture and I began
          thinking of it. Those days we were studying groups, rings and the set
          of integers congruent to c to modulus m. Probably due to that fact, I
          made my generalization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1995-Jan:</b> I was present at a mathematical conference in Rome:
          <i>First Italian Number Theory Meeting</i>.<br />
          There I met Alberto Perelli, an Italian mathematician from the
          University of Genoa, perhaps the greatest Goldbach's Conjecture
          luminary in Italy. I asked him for an opinion of my conjecture.<br />
          Alberto Perelli said that &quot;<i
            >XGC could represent a <b>simpler way</b> towards the demonstration
            of GC.</i
          >&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1996-Mar:</b> I started the 1st XGC web site under
          <a href="http://www.energymedia.net/">energymedia</a>, an ISP which I
          built with my best friend Fulvio. The first site was full featured,
          including the Java/JavaScript applet to test XGC on line. But I was
          too shy in presenting my XGC, because it was my very first time on the
          web and I cannot see the whole thing in the right perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1997-Jul:</b> I started the 2nd XGC web site under GeoCities, a
          free space/e-mail ISP. It was wonderful for me to find that all I knew
          by word of mouth about GeoCities was true! Till then I couldn't
          believe that there could be an ISP for FREE. I added to the site a lot
          of pictures of me and my family. With the second web site I put a
          counter in my XGC page and in six months it grew from zero to more
          than 65,000 accesses!!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1998-Apr:</b> Mr. Huen Yeong Kong e-mailed a lot with me to promote
          his sequence algebra formulation of GC. I was surprised by his smart
          idea: it was so simple to test XGC using sequence algebra formulation
          and a computer system for doing mathematics, like Mathematica, that
          soon I wrote some simple functions for it.<br />
          Thank you, Mr. Huen, for giving me a powerful tool to test XGC rapidly
          and to explain it clearly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1998-May:</b> I started the building of the 3rd XGC web site. On
          September 25, 1998 I uploaded it to GeoCities. On September 27, 1998 I
          had to move to Tripod, because GeoCities ads popped up from each
          frame.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2004-Nov:</b> I started the building of the 4th XGC web site. On
          November 27, 2004 I uploaded it to mondotondo and dismissed Geocities
          and Tripod, whose ads inhibited my XGC applet. <br />
          The applet has disappeared, replaced by a javascript trasnlation, that
          works pretty well. <br />
          And all the Mathematica code is now enclosed in collapsing sections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2006-Mar:</b> I fixed a parseInt bug in the javascript code for
          testing XGC. The bug was giving wrong Euclid Sets.
        </li>
      </ul>
